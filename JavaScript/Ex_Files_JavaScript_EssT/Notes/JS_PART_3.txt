Objects:
    JS is a prototype based object oriented programming language.
    Each object has a definite unique properties of it own.
    Each object is a unique instance of an object prototype.
    Methods are property-changing features inside objects.
    Another object can be a property of an object.

JS Objects:
    It is a collection data and functionality stored as properties and methods that describe the object.
    To define an object, a variable have to be created.
    To make variable an object, {}; has been assigned.
        eg: var obj={}; //empty object
    Each property is a name value pair, seperated by a colon.
    A property can be of any type.
    Each property is seperated by comma.
    "this" keyword refers to the current object.

Object Containers:
    To hold an object, a container is need, which is called variable.
    Content after equal symbol of varibale goes inside the container.
    Objects are typically constants.
    Once an object is created, we can change the properties but not the entire value of the object(ie. assigning var from {} to 5).
    To achive above thing, objects are always decalred as constants.

Object Properties:
    Object properties are defined using a colon seperated name value pair, where the name can be any string
        and is placed on the left and value can be of anything placed on the right.
    Property name should only contain letters,digits,dollar signs and underscoresz.
    If quotation marks or hypens or other symbols is added in property name, the object will not function properly.

Accessing Objects:
    Anytime to access an object or anything contained inside a variable, simply call it by its name and JS will handle it.
    To print the object directly there are many options in console, most commonly used one is console.log().

Accessing Object Properties:
    There are two ways of accessing object properties, by dot notation and by bracket notation.
    <object_name>.<property_name>
    [or]
    <object_name>[<property_name>]

    Using bracket methods helps to do advanced things.
    It helps to dynamically change the bracket value.
    If non standard names is ther is the property then using bracket method is the best one.
    
Object Methods:
    Methods are functions inside the objects.
    Each method has been added to object as property.
    There are two syntaxes for these methods.[ref functions chapter]
    Function expression:(most used one)
        <function_name> : FUNCTION (parameters...)
        {<function_statement>}
    
Classes - Object Blueprints:
    It is possible to create objects blueprints or templates using classes.
    The two different ways of creating the class are as follows:
        Class declaration: class Name {}
        Class expression:  const Name = class {}
    Class has to be declare before it has been used.

Object Constructors:
    There is another way of creating class which relies on a basic function called an object constructor function.
    It is possible to extend class when we use class object instead of object constructor function.
    Classes give more capabilities than object constructor function.
