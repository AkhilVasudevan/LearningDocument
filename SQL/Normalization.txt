Normalization:
    The process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy, which in turn ensures data consistency.

    Problems of data redundancy:
        Disk space wastage
        Data inconsistency
        DML queries ca become slow
    
    Database normalization is a step by step process.
    There are 6 normal forms, 1NF through 6NF.
    Most databases are in third normal form(3NF).
    There are certain rules, that each normal form should follow.

    First Normal Form(1NF):
        The data in each column should be atomic.
        No multiple values, separated by comma.
        The table does not contain any repeating column groups.
        Identify each record uniquely using primary key.

    Second Normal Form(2NF):
        The table meets all the conditions of 1NF.
        Move redundant data to a seperate table.
        Create relationshi between these tables using foreign keys.

    Third Normal Form(3NF):
        Meets all the conditions of 1NF and 2NF.
        Does not contain columns that are not fully dependent upon the primary key.
