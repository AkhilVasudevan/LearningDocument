                        JavaScript: A Brief Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Components:
    Objects
    Methods
    Functions
    Template literals
    Arrays

Some JS:
    Vanilla JS
    vue.js
    React
    Angular
    CoffeeScript
    TypeScript
    ES2015
    ES6
    Node.js
    JSX
    etc...

JS Landscape:
    The core language; somtimes referred to as vanilla JavaScript or Vannilla JS.

    The browser specification of the javascript langauage is ECMAScript.
    It is a description about how the language should be interpreted by the browser.

    ES6, ES2015,ES2017,ES2020, etc. refers to the use of features defined in ECMAScript,
        but not necessarily supported by modern browser.

    Using ECMAScript usually means also using Babel.js to make it work in current browser implementations.

    other tools like babel are  npm, WebPack,Gulp,etc.

Tools for JS:
    Modern browser - ideally all the browser for testing
    Code editor - Visual Studio Code is becoming the industry standard
    Liver Server environment - extension to VS Code 
    The browser console - available in browsers

    Install Live server extension in vs code

Linting and Formatting:
    ESLint and Prettier can be used for linting and formatting.
    Prettier helps automatically cleanup formatting.
    ESLint helps automatically detect coding errors and can dp basic cleanup automatically.
    
Browser Console:
    JS works on browser, as there will be console to directly interact with JS.

    In browser console,
        window.document - it will give the html code of the window
    
    From console we can access the variables and function of the js code.
    If we change the value from console, we can also see the changes in the browser output also.
    For that we have to write a function to alter in browser window also.

JS Basics:
    Write JS from top to bottom.
    Declare variables, functions, objects, etc.. before using it.
    // & /**/ have been used for commenting.
    Browser does not care about space in js.
    It can use single or doube; quotes for string.
    It is optional to put semicolon after each statement.
